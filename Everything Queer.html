      <h3>Bisexualism Stigma</h3>
      <p>October is LGBT History Month. It is a time for us to recognize historic LGBT leaders and celebrate the progress made towards full LGBT equality.
        But the stigma towards bisexual people continues to hold back their authenticity.
        Bisexuals experience high rates of being ignored, discriminated against, demonized, or rendered invisible by both the heterosexual world and the lesbian and gay communities.
        Often, the entire sexual orientation is branded as invalid, immoral, or irrelevant.
        Despite years of activism, the needs of bisexuals still go unaddressed and their very existence is still called into question</p>

      <h3>The Pink Triangle</h3>
      <p>Hitler saw gay men as a threat to his campaign to purify Germany, especially because their partnerships could not bear children who would grow the Aryan race he wanted to cultivate.
      Prisoners that the nazis considered as homosexual were required to wear an inverted pink triangle on their chest.The <i>prink triangle</i> was assigned to "sexual deviants."
      This included gay men,bisexual men,transgender women,pedophiles,zoophiles and sex offenders.In the 1970s, gay liberation advocates began to reclaim the <i>pink triangle</i>,turning it into a symbol of protest.
      Each June,a 200-foot-long <i>pink triangle</i> is installed in the mountains of San Francisco and is lit up at night.</p>

      <h3>Gender Non-Binary</h3>
      <p>Most people – including most transgender people – are either male or female. But some people don't neatly fit into the categories of "man" or "woman," or “male” or “female.” For example, some people have a gender that blends elements of being a man or a woman, or a gender that is different than either male or female.
      Some people don't identify with any gender. Some people's gender changes over time.
      People whose gender is not male or female use many different terms to describe themselves, with non-binary being one of the most common. Other terms include genderqueer, agender, bigender, and more.
      None of these terms mean exactly the same thing – but all speak to an experience of gender that is not simply male or female.</p>
