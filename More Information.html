      <h3>The event that inspired the Pride parades was a march to commemorate the Stonewall Riots.</h3>
      <p>In 1970, a year after the Stonewall Inn rebellion thousands of LGBT New Yorkers gathered for the Christopher Street Liberation Day (CSLD) March along Sixth Avenue from Greenwich Village to Central Park, chanting, “Say it clear, say it loud! Gay is good, gay is proud!” The success of the CSLD March inspired local organizers across the United States and around the globe to start their own LGBT marches.</p>

      <h3>Every color of the rainbow flag means something.</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wondered what the rainbow gay pride flag flown at Pride parades means? The original flag few at the Gay Freedom Day Parade in San Francisco in 1978, and was designed by Gilbert Baker.
         Thirty volunteers hand-dyed and stitched the first two flags for the parade.
         Baker assigned different meanings to each color. Hot pink represents sexuality. Red represents life. Orange represents healing. Yellow represents sunlight.
      Green represents nature. Turquoise represents magic and art. Indigo represents serenity and harmony.
        Violet represents spirit. Stripes were eventually dropped from the design for mass production, resulting in the six-stripe flag that’s popular today. </p>
